Imagine there’s a vast ocean under the surface of Mars, spiraling around the core, full of living beings, far unimaginable than what we see on our planet. 

Today, my team and I would like to present to you an ocean world where life thrives at it’s natural resources rather than the sun.

I am Zohora Ema, along with 5 of my proficient teammates. We are Team Kaiyo. 

We live on the earth where all living beings thrive under the sunlight. What if there exists a planet, where life exists yet they’ve never basked in the warmth of sunlight? 

I always had a dream to venture into the universe and meet with other living beings. The desire became stronger, but the older I grew, the more I learned about the scarcity of such an environment. In university we arrange a group of similar minds to create a virtual world and simulate how it can be habitable. The challenge we are participating in aligns with our goal, which is about  An Aquatic Chemosynthetic world, beyond sunlight, arranged by NASA, where we’ll explore the potential of life based on natural minerals. 

Our plan is to create a virtual world along with its solar system, as well as represent the planetary data, where Roudra and Ratul will develop the web interface. The biological data will be analyzed and presented by Mehedi and I, finally Atik and Arka will handle the geographical and 3D modeling.

We took our inspiration from the ocean under Enceladus, Titan and Mimas. The life deep beneath the ocean of our planet and the extremophiles gave us the knowledge and idea to create a world where life thrives on the minerals and the environment. We emulated and planned the ocean and the lifecycle of the newly created organisms and their evolution.

We planned the entire planet and its weather and environment and how it was developed over billions of years (without any use of AI). The sub-surface water broke through the solid crust and formed the ocean. The ocean bed became the host of the first life forms and the source of energy.

What amazed us most is how biofilm survive in harsh environment and can form more rigid and solid body and act as a single organism. We took this as a base and created our organisms that can form a colony and act as a single organism.


This may be an imaginary world but imagination is where innovation starts. 

At an early stage, it may seem like a lifeless simulation, but that can’t be a boundary. With proper physics and a controlled environment, both life and machines can be experimented on how they behave in different systems. 

Maybe one day, with more knowledge and advancement of technology, these organisms may show signs of intelligence or even foreshadow our path to civilize the universe. 

This is Team Kaiyo, and we hope our dream captures your imagination.
