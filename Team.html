						<p id="intro-segment-text">
							Gaia Derinkuyu is a hollowed planet filled with liquid water and surface is covered with
							Volcanic
							rocks and Ice. Due to the lack of atmosphere and extreme thin air life may seem impossible
							here, but the nature works in a mysterious way under the shed.

							<br>
							Long distance from its star <a href="/Solar-System.html" style="color: goldenrod;">"Sidus
								Ignis"</a> keeps it cold while the Volcanic surface carry the heat to the deep water
							body, maintaining the temperature of the planet <i>(300¬∞C at day to -38¬∞C at night)</i>. The
							planet is also known for its rich minerals and unique combination magnetic and centrifugal
							force which gives it's interior a unique shape.

					<!-- Namesake -->

					<div id="namesake-segment">
						<h2 id="namesake-segment-header">Namesake:</h2>
						<p id="namesake-segment-text">
							Gaia Derinkuyu is a name that combines two significant elements:
							<br><br>
							<b>Gaia:</b> This is a Greek goddess of the Earth. In Greek mythology, Gaia is considered
							the mother of all living things. Her name is often associated with the Earth itself, its
							natural processes, and its nurturing qualities.
							<br>
							<b>Derinkuyu:</b> This is a Turkish word meaning "deep well." It refers to the underground
							city of Derinkuyu in Cappadocia, Turkey. This ancient city is known for its extensive
							network of tunnels, chambers, and underground structures, which were used as a refuge and a
							place of habitation.
							<br><br>
							Together, the name Gaia Derinkuyu reflects the planet's connection to the life and the
							darkness of its hidden depths.

					<!-- Size and Distance -->

					<div id="size-distance">
						<h2 id="size-distance-header">Size and Distance:</h2>
						<p id="size-distance-text">
							Gaia Derinkuyu is a relatively small planet compared to others in the solar system. It has
							a diameter of approximately <b>6,792 kilometers (4,220 miles)</b>, making it slightly larger
							than
							Mercury.
							<br>
							The planet is located at a distance of about 0.72 astronomical units (AU) from its
							star, Sidus Ignis. This distance places it within the habitable zone of the star, where
							conditions are suitable for the presence of liquid water.
