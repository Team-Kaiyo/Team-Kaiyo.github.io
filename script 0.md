Imagine there’s an ocean under the surface of Mars, there’s a vast ocean, spiraling around the core, full of living beings, far unimaginable than what we see on our planet. 

Today, my team and I would like to present to you an ocean world where life thrives at it’s natural resources rather than the sun.

I am Ratul Hasan, along with 5 of my proficient teammates. We are Team Kaiyo. 

We live on the earth where all living beings thrive under the sunlight. What if there exists a planet, where life exists yet they’ve never basked in the warmth of sunlight? 

I always had a dream to venture into the universe and meet with other living beings. The desire became stronger, but the older I grew, the more I learned about the society of such an environment. So, I decided to arrange a group of similar minds to create a virtual world and simulate how it can be habitable. The challenge we are participating in aligns with our goal, which is about  An Aquatic Chemosynthetic world, beyond sunlight, arranged by NASA, where we‘ll explore the potential of life based on natural minerals. 

Our plan is to create a virtual world along with its solar system, as well as represent the planetary data, where Roudra and I will develop the web interface. The biological data will be analyzed and presented by Ema and Mehedi, geographical analysis by Atik, and 3D with the help of Arka. 

This may be an imaginary world but imagination is where innovation starts. 

At an early stage, it may seem like a lifeless simulation, but that can’t be a boundary. With proper physics and a controlled environment, both life and machines can be experimented on how they behave in different systems. 

Maybe one day, with more knowledge and advancement of technology, these organisms may show signs of intelligence or even foreshadow our path to civilize the universe. 

 This is Team Kaiyo, and we hope you will find our dream interesting.
